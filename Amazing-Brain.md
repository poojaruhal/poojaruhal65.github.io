## Do programming languages shape our mind as the natural languages do?

Have you ever come across a situation where you look at the efforts, our programming community is making towards bridging the gap between a natural language and a programming language. Why making a powerful language is so important in all aspects of real life and programming aspects? What is the effect of a language on our brain? 


### Our Amazing Brain
Human brain flabbergasts me, whenever I analyze my thought process or someone else, it scares me with its unimaginable capabilities. Some actions performed by us seems quite simple but simplicity leaves us in a jaw-dropping situation if we take some time to dissect those actions. The time you are struggling with an obstacle that looks unsolvable initially but then a sparkle in your brain leads you to a very elegant solution. The feeling you get that time is hard to express even by a language.

One of the areas that always put humans as superior over other species is "Communication" and how we learn and use languages.
We often discuss how languages give different cognitive abilities to us and how they affect our brain to behave or think in a particular way. For example, there is a community in Africa who talk to each other in directions and that too without the left or right word in their vocabulary. They use precise directions like the north-west/south-west. Can you imagine this? Try saying "I felt pain in my left foot" without the word "left" and using precise direction like the north-west foot. Every time we think about languages, our mind fills with lots of surprises and questions as well.

There is another area where we use languages to communicate and express our thoughts. Those languages also have a culture associated with them, a community who actively uses them and an environment. This community is a bit different. It involves livings(us) and non-living(the whole world of software)both.

This deadly combination of the physical and virtual world demands its language to be more powerful but less low level, more expressive but easy to comprehend, more transparent but less complex, more relatable to the human world but not less connected to a machine. There are endless requirements in the ocean of different goal-oriented tasks but there is no perfect solution. So we have to work in different languages and for that, we need to learn them. Although we should not put the same efforts in every new language, we should understand the meta-concepts and by that, we should be able to grab any language with a minimum amount of time and effort. This minimum time amount is a cognitive process. A process that baffles you, leaves you in an ocean of confusing thoughts, makes you feel frustrated and helpless, hinders you to think the actual solution or molds your views unconsiously. So again languages, a bit different languages, stamp our mind with piles of questions but this time we compare with a process we are going through since our childhood.

Let's give our brain a thought. Let's face the questions. 
Whatever thoughts we go through while learning a new natural language, do we feel the same process for a programming language also? This question gives us a few interesting and concrete questions. 

- Do we face the same cognitive challenges while learning a programming language as a natural language?
- Is there any relation between a natural language and a programming language and if yes what is that relationship?
- Do any of given language influence each other in any way?
- Is there any effect of programming language on the cognitive skills of developers like the way natural language has?
- Do programming language and the community associated with the language shows any pattern and if yes what that pattern means to us?.

Take a break, ask yourself 

### Now we know the questions, let's see what our brain wants us to discover.
As most of us have these questions in our mind at some point, either suddenly popped or unconsciously suppressed in other thoughts but we do have them.
So we thought of thinking about this unique "thought".

Our thought process started with a question “how developers understand software”. We were interested in knowing the kinds of tools they use to understand software. We did a survey of novice developers and also a few savvy developers. We got answers that they don’t use much analysis tools and tends to stick with features provided by IDE tools, also they took help of peers followed by a bit of documentation. Here come the twist, documentation, and peers (means the people in the community), both are related to natural language and also a common programming language associated. So much of the information, these two ways provide are expressed in natural language. This made us conclude that yes both are related. The natural language you use in writing documentation or listening peers when they tells you about the software creates mental impressions. We treat few words specials over others and thus establish a foundation of a tradition for future developers in the community

When we look at Java documentation developers have a specific style of writing documnetation. They neither use the proper and complete sentence of a natural language nor of programming language. They sticks mostly with annotations while If we look at Pharo community, their thoughts are expressed in different ways. Pharo community uses a completely different language pattern.  In Pharo, most of the documentation is provided via class comments. So we started looking at the class comments and analyzing the linguistic pattern of developers. We found that Pharo community uses complete sentence and objects are treated more like humans. Objects talk to each other or at least the language creates enough convincing illusion that they interact in the same way as we humans do. The whole environment supports this beautiful illusion. A class is also an object and tells its responsibilities by using the pronoun "I". Another interesting fact is the choice of words are different. So the language and its community have a pattern and this pattern is made to inspire developers to connect to the virtual world in a meaningful way.

**Isn't it mysterious that two languages sometimes trying to solve the same problem but express themselves and their system in totally different ways?**

 ### How a langauge effect our brain?
 
 Languages can have **devasting** effect in terms of API/methods we write, and mysterious effect like having more algebra libraries makes a language more oriented to use it for statistics.
**Just little stepping stones give a whole new world of cognitive skills.**

Language can have an **early** effect like the programming language you start with, you start mapping and comparing to previous languages while learning a new. This comparision can sometimes hinders you to explore the new dimension.
Language can also have a **longer** effect in a way of modeling problems until unless you really stop working with that language intensely. You start to talk in terms of that language even in your daily life. Trust me it happens.
Language can have a **good** effect as learning a new language forces you to think in a different way and change your mindset.
Language can have a **bad** effect also when you are too comfortable with that language and it does not surprise you anymore. This means your brain has stopped making new neural connections and also stop pushing your cognitive skills limits.  I like a famous quote that beautifully summarizes the good and bad effect- 
**"If a language does not change your mindset, it is not worth learning".**

Now seeing those effects people get scares to change their programming language. Some people always argue that a programming language should not be a barrier and you should think of irrespective of a language, to be precise in terms of the algorithm. Algorithms are the basic foundations.
**But is it really possible to align yourself irrespective of language you are working in?**

As we said, languages are a way of expressing our thoughts.
When we model software entities, language effects. The classes and methods we come up while modeling entities in Java would be different than the way you model entities in Pharo. I personally felt this a lots of time, atleast in initial modeling phase.
So **developers of different languages construct the same ‘reality’ in alternate ways.**

Our mind has an inventory of amodal and abstract concepts derived from evolution and experience. It is not what we think “in" language rather, language directly interfaces with the mental representation that is used in perception and action. Some studies claim that "people are programmable". The languages can program our mind by interfacing with grounded mental states. 

When we looked closely at language effect, it is not just a language. There is another hidden layer in this software world that is named "The programming environment".  The environment is strongly bound with a language. This combination shapes our brain to program in a certain way. We will have another session of discussion how a language and its environment are bound together.

The complexity of our thought increases when we realize that languages are not a static entity. They are meant to evolve with time like our natural languages involves. People find new ways to express their thoughts.

**"Languages are not just a communication system; it is a control system,”** mentioned by "How Language Programs the Mind”.

This journey of thought process made us visualize this language relation in different axis. It is no more a single entity that effects our software. We came up with 3 axes, a language axis, its environment, and natural language.

How we are supposed to incorporate the language evolution with its environment evolution and natural language evolution.

What do you think?
